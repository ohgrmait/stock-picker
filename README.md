  <h1>Stock Picker</h1>

  The Best Day to Buy and Sell Stocks
</div>

## About
`stock-picker` is a classic "intro to programming problem" wherein the method `stock_picker(stock_prices)` takes in an array of stock prices and returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.[^1]

[^1]: [This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker) is from the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

## Self Reflections
- > I ended up choosing the [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) path. As a result, I've started with the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) and learned quite a lot of things like basic data types, variables, input and output, conditional logic, loops, arrays, hashes, methods, debugging, basic and predicate enumerable methods, and nested collections.
